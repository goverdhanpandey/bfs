# bfs in c
BFS is a traversal algorithm that is applied mostly on the graphs to travel from one node to another node for various manipulation and usage. The visit on each node using the BFS algorithm makes the entire algorithm treated as an efficient and useful algorithm. There are certain ways to traverse from one node to another node in a graph using the BFS algorithm in the sense that the selected node will be encountered first, followed by the next node to be reached either breadthwise or moving to the node directly. In this topic, we are going to learn about the BFS algorithm in C
